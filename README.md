## üöÄ How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Login to LinkedIn
- The automation script logs in using the provided credentials.
- It redirects to the profile that needs to be scraped.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scraping Post Details

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting Reactions
- Locates all reaction buttons (like, celebrate, support, etc.).
- Clicks each button to open the overlay with the list of people who reacted.
- Scrapes **names** and **profile URLs** of all reactors.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Bot Detection
- To avoid bot detection, the script logs in again before proceeding further.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Scraping Comments
- Visits each **post URL** again one by one.
- Clicks the **"Load more comments"** button until all comments are visible.
- Extracts **comment text**, **commenter's name**, and **profile URL**.
